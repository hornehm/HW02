Hey Heather, here are some notes about your program.

-The findClickedCircle method doesn't always grab the cirlce
on the first click (may be something I did). I think that 
this may be due to the drawing method making the circles 
larger than they should be. I couldn't find the exact 
reason why. However, it does work for the most part.

-The drawing methods that you're using to create the surface
make the program run slowly. It's much faster to use the 
openGL functions to draw circles, and then you don't have to
use a surface and cycle through each pixel.

-You may want to make your class member variables with the
trailing '_' to make them easier to identify at a glance.


Notes:

-The reason you probably weren't able to separate the classes
is because you were using pragma once instead of 'ifndef'. I
don't exactly know how pragma once works, but check out 'ifndef'
on Cplusplus.com . It's basically an if-else for your preprocessor;
saying, if this class is NOT defined already, define this class.

-The clicked circle method was fine as far as I remember. Maybe 
one instance of using next instead of previous, but you just needed
to create a different mouse event and include the code instead of
using the '2' keypress to cycle.

-The node drawing order wasn't putting the selected circles on
the 'top' of the list (after sentinel).

Overall, I think this was an awesome project. It looks like you 
were just rushed a bit at the end. I'm very impressed with the
text instructions. I'm still having trouble figuring out 
how you did it.
